# Roll-A-Ball
Roll a ball Unity 4 take 2

My game for my final project is called Nom Noms. It is a marble blaster clone in which a player must roll around a 3D world collecting (Eating) yellow cubes before time runs out and without falling off the edge. 

The controls are simple:
Use WASD or alternatively the arrow keys to move around the world
Use the mouse to look around the world
Use spacebar to jump on the base level plain
